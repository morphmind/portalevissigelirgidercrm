## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager
-   A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/villa_flow_finance_tracker.git
    cd villa_flow_finance_tracker
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Bun for package management.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Authenticate with Cloudflare:**
    Log in to your Cloudflare account to be able to run the development server and deploy.
    ```bash
    bunx wrangler login
    ```

## üíª Development

To start the local development server, which includes both the Vite frontend and the Cloudflare Worker backend, run:

```bash
bun dev
```

This command will:
-   Start the Vite development server for the React frontend with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
-   Start a local `workerd` process for the Hono API backend.
-   Proxy requests from `/api/*` to the local worker.

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for seamless deployment to Cloudflare Pages.

1.  **Build the application:**
    This command bundles the frontend and backend assets for production.
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
    Run the deploy script to publish your application.
    ```bash
    bun run deploy
    ```

Wrangler will handle the process of uploading your static assets and worker script to the Cloudflare network.

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository with a single click:

## üîó API & Data Flow

The application uses a client-server architecture.
-   The **React frontend** manages the UI and user interactions. It uses TanStack Query to communicate with the backend, handling data fetching, caching, and mutations.
-   The **Hono backend**, running on a Cloudflare Worker, exposes a RESTful API for CRUD operations on transactions.
-   All application state is persisted in a single global **Durable Object**, which provides transactional guarantees and consistent storage.
